## Results and Demonstrations

This project provides a basic example of AI application in space exploration. The `ai_for_space_exploration.py` script demonstrates a simple satellite image classification using a RandomForestClassifier, showcasing how AI can be used to analyze astronomical data. Future work will involve more complex models and real-world datasets.

## Future Work

*   Integrate with real-time satellite data streams for autonomous analysis.
*   *   Develop advanced deep learning models for complex image recognition and anomaly detection.
    *   *   Explore reinforcement learning for autonomous spacecraft navigation and decision-making.
        *   *   Collaborate with space agencies and research institutions to apply AI to ongoing missions.
